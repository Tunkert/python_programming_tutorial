# Variable rules
# 1. Variables can only contain letters, numbers, and underscores.
# 2. Variable names can start with a letter or underscore but not with a number.
# 3. Variable names cannot contain spaces.
# 4. Variable names cannot contain Python keywords or function names.
# 5. Variable names should be descriptive but not unnecessarily long.
# 6. Variables names with lower case l and uppercase O can be confused with 1 and 0.
